At the Tidal AI Machine Learning Hackathon, our team excelled in an intense 8-hour challenge to create EduInsights. This innovative tool merges rainforest tree models with linear regression to evaluate student performance, focusing on their educational habits and backgrounds. Designed to assist educators in identifying students needing extra support, EduInsights is a testament to our collaborative effort. We collectively sharpened our skills in rapid prototyping, team-based problem-solving, and data analytics, all within a stringent timeframe. This project not only advanced our collective expertise in machine learning but also highlighted the impact of agile, data-driven solutions in the realm of educational technology.
